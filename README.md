# Meme Library

This is a website that integrates my Discord bot (https://github.com/Izarothy/Gandalf), which fetches memes from a channel and sends them to a MongoDB database. The backend from here consumes that data and turns it into React components - you can search through them and get full-sized versions. 

It was a pretty fun experience - I learned a few things along the way (integrating with a database, creating an API endpoint in Next.js, conditionally rendering items from received data). Feedback or change requests are always welcome, especially design wise.
